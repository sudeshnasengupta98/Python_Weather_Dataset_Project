Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project consists of weather data collected over a period of time. It includes the following variables:

Date/Time
Temperature (°C)
Dew Point Temperature (°C)
Relative Humidity (%)
Wind Speed (km/h)
Visibility (km)
Pressure (kPa)
Weather Condition
Project Objectives
Explore the weather dataset to understand its structure, features, and distribution of data.
Clean the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and formatting issues to prepare it for analysis.
Perform in-depth analysis of the weather data, including statistical summaries and visualizations.
Create insightful visualizations to effectively communicate trends, patterns, and insights within the data.
Extract meaningful insights from the data analysis, such as seasonal temperature trends, common weather occurrences, and correlations between weather variables.
